chit: |+
  To get a cheat sheet:
  $ chit [cheatsheet]
  
  To edit a cheat sheet, use the --edit switch.
  $ cheat [cheatsheet] --edit
  
  To add a cheat sheet, use the --add switch.
  $ cheat [cheatsheet] --add
  
  During editing a cheat sheet, empty the content will get the cheat sheet removed.
  
  A prefix '@' indicates the cheat sheet is in private mode. A private cheat sheet is kept in another repository.
  
  To get your private cheat sheet:
  $ chit @[cheatsheet]
  
  The prefix '@' works the same for both --edit and --add.
  
  The cheat sheet can be in a path. For example:
  $ chit mysql/select
  will get the cheat sheet 'select' under mysql.
  
  To find cheat sheets begin with 'name', use the --find/-f switch
  
  $ chit name --find
  
  To search cheat sheets content with 'text', use the --search/-s switch
  
  $ chit text --search
