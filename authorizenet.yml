  Error Codes
  ===========
  
  "When testing transaction results in the developer test environment as well as the production environment, you can produce a specific response reason code [0] by submitting a test transaction using a test credit card number designed to generate specific transaction results." [1]
  
  Quick example:  when using the Visa Error Test Card, a charge of $1.00 will always generate a successful transaction, while $2.00 will always be declined.  See References and Authorize.net developer documentation for further information.
