  INSTALLING
  ----------
  $ sudo gem install haml
  
  To create plugin hook in Rails:
  $ haml --rails /path/to/app
  
  See 'haml --help' for command-line compiling options.
  
  NUTSHELL
  --------
  Think of Haml as HTML/Erb with open/close tags replaced by indentation
  conventions.  It's a "dumb" syntax compiler which directly transliterates
  any element you specify to XHTML, with no validation.  The key benefit
  is clean reading and elegant presentation.  Many developers find pages
  and views written in Haml more maintainable than XHTML.
  
  Whitespace rules in Haml are very strict.  Nesting is specified by 
  indenting the contained content two spaces from the enclosing block.
  For example:
  
  %html
    %h1 My title.
    %p
      This is a paragraph.  Here I will specify some
      %strong 
        bold and
        %em italicized
        text.
    %p Another paragraph.
  
  ...maps to:
  
  <html>
    <h1>My title.</h1>
    <p>
      This is a paragraph.  Here I will specify some
      <strong>
        bold and
        <em>italicized</em>
        text.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>Another paragraph.</p>
  </html>
  
  
  SYNTAX
  ------
  !!! - doctype specifier, e.g. !!! Strict
    Inserts an HTML DOCTYPE or XML declaration.  Default is XHTML 1.0
    Transitional, but other formats can be given.  (See Haml docs.) 
  
  % - element specifier, e.g. %h1
    Wraps everything following on the same line *or* nested in following
    indented lines with open/close element tags: <element>stuff</element>
  
  # - id specifier, e.g. #main or %div#main
    Sets an 'id' attribute on an element.  If %element is not specified, 
    creates an implied <div> element.
  
  . - class specifier, e.g. .error or %li.error
    Sets a 'class' attribute on an element.  If %element is not specified,
    creates an implied <div> element.  Classes can be chained with multiple
    periods.
  
  {} - attributes, e.g. %input{:name => "title", :length => "30"}
    Sets attributes on an element, taking either Ruby hash key/value pairs
    or one or more Ruby methods which return a hash.
  
  [] - id and class from Ruby object, e.g. %div[@content]    
    Sets the 'class' and 'id' attributes based on the class and 
    class-plus-object-id of the specified Ruby object.
  
  / (at end of tag definition) - self-closing tag, e.g. %br/
    Specifies a self-closing tag.  (Some tags are self-closed by default.)
  
  / (at start of line) - comment, e.g. / Here there be tygers.
    Creates an HTML comment from the content on the line or nested beneath.
  
  \ - escape character, e.g. \. (to render a period at the start of a line)
    Allows 'special' characters from this list to be rendered as plain text.
  
  | - multi-line string, e.g. This | (break) is one | (break) line.
    Joins the line with the following line in the output.  Keeps the
    Haml line-breaking rules from looking too ugly on inline tags.
  
  > - trim whitespace outside tag, e.g. %span> single-word (break) .
    Keeps whitespace from being automatically inserted outside the
    specified tag.  Useful for preserving punctuation with inline tags.
  
  < - trim whitespace inside tags, e.g. %tr< (break) %td
    Keeps whitespace from being automatically inserted inside the specified
    tag.  Useful for nesting tags that logically should go on one line.
  
  : - filter following content, e.g. :markdown
    Runs nested content through another filter process and embeds the
    result.  See Haml docs for list of supported filters.
  
  = - Ruby expression, e.g. %h1= @content.title or = @content.title
    Works just like the Erb = marker: the Ruby expression following it is
    evaluated and its result inserted into the document.  May follow a tag
    or stand on a line by itself.
  
  - - Ruby non-printing code, e.g. - for content in @contents do
    Works just like the Erb - marker: the Ruby expression is evaluated but
    no output goes into the document.  Primarily used for flow control and
    the quirky Rails form_for syntax.
  
  ~ - Ruby expression preserving whitespace, e.g. %pre~ @content.body
    Works just like =, but calls the find_and_preserve helper to keep
    line breaks intact in the output.
  
  == - Ruby interpolated string, e.g. %h1== Now editing #{@content.title}
    Works just like = followed by a double-quoted string.  Content is 
    treated as a literal with Ruby variable substitutions.
  
  &= - Ruby sanitized expression, e.g. %h1&= @content.title_from_user
    Works just like = but sanitizes HTML-unsafe characters in output by
    converting to escaped entities.  Also see :escape_html option.
  
  != - Ruby unsanitized expression, e.g. #body!= @content.generated_html
    Works just like = but *never* sanitizes output, regardless of whether
    the :escape_html option is set.
  
  -# - Silent comment, e.g. -# The users are all idiots.
    Contained content is never output.
