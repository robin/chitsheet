  Tracking and contributing to the trunk of a Subversion-managed project:
  
  # Clone a repo (like git clone):
          git-svn clone http://svn.foo.org/project/trunk
  # Enter the newly cloned directory:
          cd trunk
  # You should be on master branch, double-check with git-branch
          git branch
  # Do some work and commit locally to git:
          git commit ...
  # Something is committed to SVN, rebase your local changes against the
  # latest changes in SVN:
          git-svn rebase
  # Now commit your changes (that were committed previously using git) to SVN,
  # as well as automatically updating your working HEAD:
          git-svn dcommit
  # Append svn:ignore settings to the default git exclude file:
          git-svn show-ignore >> .git/info/exclude
  # Some useful aliases
          spull = svn rebase
          spush = svn dcommit
          sfetch = svn fetch
