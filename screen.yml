  =TO START SCREEN=
  $ screen
  $ screen -ls: to list running sessions
  
  From: http://www.amitu.com/blog/2004/12/screen-howto.html
  To connect to an already open session running in background, use "screen" with following options:
     * -D -R  Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely first. If it was not running create it and notify the user. This is the author's favorite.
     * -r     Reattach to existing
     * -d -r  Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.
     * -d -R  Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.
     * -d -RR Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first session if more than one session is available.
     * -D -r  Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.
     * -D -RR Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.
  
     * -r <PID> Reattach to the session with process ID of <PID>

  C-a :resize +N  : increase current region height by N
  C-a :resize -N  : decrease current region height by N
  C-a :resize N   : set current region height to N
  C-a :resize =   : make all windows equally high
  C-a :resize max : maximize current region height
  C-a :resize min : minimize current region height
