  $ screen
  $ screen -ls: to list running sessions
  
  From: http://www.amitu.com/blog/2004/12/screen-howto.html
  To connect to an already open session running in background, use "screen" with following options:
     * -D -R  Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is running, then reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely first. If it was not running create it and notify the user. This is the author's favorite.
     * -r     Reattach to existing
     * -d -r  Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.
     * -d -R  Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.
     * -d -RR Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use the first session if more than one session is available.
     * -D -r  Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely first.
     * -D -RR Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.
