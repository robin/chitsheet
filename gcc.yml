  Oft used gcc commands
  =======================
  
  $g++ --version           Returns the version of gcc
  $g++ -c sourceFile.cpp   Compiles a single source file into an object file
  $g++ -o Program.exe source1.o source2.o source3.o    Links a series of object files into 
                                                       a single executable.
                                                       -o means "output" and is followed by a filename
  To include debug symbols, use -g during compiling:
  $g++ -c -g sourceFile.cpp    compiles a single soruce file with debug info into an object file
  
  For the following examples, assume this directory structure:
  
  /Dir
  /Dir/source   [Contains:  File1.cpp   File2.cpp]
  /Dir/include  [Contains:  File1.h     File1.h]
  /Dir/lib      [will contain output libraries]
  /Dir/obj      [temporarily used to contain .o object files
  
  Create a static (.a) library from two source files:
  -----
  g++ -c -I./include ./source/File1.cpp -o ./obj/File1.o
  g++ -c -I./include ./source/File2.cpp -o ./obj/File2.o
  ar rc ./lib/libLib1.a ./obj/File1.o ./obj/File2.o
  
  Create a shared (.so) library from two source files:
  -----
  g++ -c -fPIC -o ./obj/File1.o -I./include ./source/File1.cpp
  g++ -c -fPIC -o ./obj/File2.o -I./include ./source/File2.cpp
  g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,./lib/libLib1.so.1 -o ./lib/libLib1.so.1.0 ./obj/File1.o ./obj/File2.o
  
  Note: the linker will prefer (use first) shared libraries (.so) if found
        over static (.a) libraries, unless explicitly directed to use static libs.
  
  Create an executable binary from a source file + **static** library, use the
   -static switch.  Will increase size, but allow exe to run on systems w/out
   a shared library.
  First compile the file, then create the exe by linking in Lib1,
   placing the binary in ./bin/main.exe
  -----
  g++ -c -I./include -I../Lib1/include ./source/main.cpp -o ./obj/main.o
  g++ -static ./obj/main.o -L../Lib1/lib -lLib1 -o ./bin/main.exe
  
  Create an executable binary from a source file + **dynamic** library:
  Note: the .so library must be present during compile and run time, unless
   a shared .a version is found.  If a shared .a version is found (after searching
   and failing to find a .so library), it will be linked in statically.
   This means that this particular .so library need not be present at run
   time, as it is part of the exe. This increases the size (often times considerably)
   of the resultant exe.
  
  First compile the file, then create the exe by linking in Lib1,
   placing the binary in ./bin/main.exe
  -----
  g++ -c -I./include -I../Lib1/include ./source/main.cpp -o ./obj/main.o
  g++ ./obj/main.o -L../Lib1/lib -lLib1 -o ./bin/main.exe
  
  -------------------------
  
  Notes on building, order, undefined reference, etc...
  
  Assume you have two libraries and an exe project: Lib1, Lib2, and exe.
    Lib2 depends on Lib1 (ie, uses functions / classes from Lib1), and the 
    exe project depends on both Libs.
  
  You can build Lib1 error free even if you don't define all the functions
    that have been declared within it.
  
  You can build Lib2 error free even if Lib1 hasn't defined all symbols. This
    is true whether or not Lib2 expicitly makes calls to the missing functions.
  
  Once you try to link the Libs into the exe, however, you will get the
    error "undefined reference".
  
  If the function is undefined in Lib1, and then used in Lib2 in a function, and
    then that function from Lib2 is used in exe, it will reference Lib2. 
  
  If it is undefined in Lib1 and used directly from exe (without being used in
    Lib2), it will reference only the missing reference without mentioning Lib2.
  
  If the function is undefined and never used, you will not receive any errors.
  
  If an undefined function from Lib1 is used in Lib2, and that function from
    Lib2 is *not* used in the exe, then you will not receive any errors.
  
  You can build either Lib1 or Lib2 first, no matter which library depends on
    which.  But both must be built before building the exe.
