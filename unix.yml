  One of Unix's most useful features is its large number of text/data manipulations programs. Some of the more propular include:
  
  = FILE MANUPULATION
  
  * mkdir - make directory
    mkdir -p /dir/new/dirs/even/if/not/existing
  * ln - symbolic links
    ln -s ../source/file dest/file      # symbolic link named dest/file to dest/../source/file
    ln -s ../source/file dest/          # same, since name is assumed
  * sudo - run a command as root
  * cd, pushd - change directories
  * ps - list running processes
  * touch - modify updated time of a file (creating if doesn't exist)
  * rm - remove file
  * df - disk space free
  * du - disk space usage
  
  = ARCHIVE FILES
  
  * tar - archive many files
    tar xvzf file.tar.gz  # extracts
    tar xvjf file.tar.bz2 # extracts
    tar cvjf file.tar.bz2 file1 file2 file3
  * zip, unzip, arj, rar, compress - more formats
  
  = WORKING ON MANY FILES
  
  * find
    find . -iname *.foo -type f -print -exec command {} \\; # executes command on each *.foo file below given directory
  * xargs
    find . -iname *.foo -type f -print0 | xargs -0 command # run command on each *.foo file.  (Those are zeros, not oh's.)
  * for x in y ; do ... ; done
    for foo in *4?.* ; do echo $foo ; done
  
  = LEARN MORE, LEARN WHERE
  
  * man - manual page for a command
  * info - man, but different
  * help - learn about a shell internal function
  * apropos - search for word across man pages
  * which - show path to an executable
  * locate - show path for any file whose **name** contains substring
  * basename, dirname - get the file part / directory part of a pathname
  
  = PROCESSING TEXT FILES
  
  * cat - concatenate and display files
  * less - output contents of a file interactively
  * echo, printf - print a given string
  * sort - sort and collate lines
  * uniq - remove or report adjacent duplicate lines
  * diff - display line-by-line differences between pairs of text files
    diff -ruwqN /dir/tree/old /dir/tree/new # all files that differ
  * patch - apply differences between two files
    diff -ruwq  /dir/tree/old /dir/tree/new > patch # create patch
  * grep, egrep, fgrep - search a file for a string or regular expression
  * tail, head
    tail -n 50 file.txt  # last 50 lines
    head -50   file.txt  # first 50 lines
  * hexdump - show binary contents
  * strings - show any contained ASCII (non-binary) sequences
  * file - guess the type of a file
  
  = COLUMN-ORIENTED UTILITIES
  
  * cut - remove selected fields from each line of a file
  * paste - join corresponding lines of several files, or subsequent lines of one file
  * nl - line number
  * colrm - remove characters from specified columns within each line
  * expand, unexpand - expand TAB characters to SPACE characters, and vice versa
  * wc - word (line, letter) count
    wc file1 file2 dir/*
  
  = OBSOLETE
  
  While sed, awk and tr are still used, and still useful, any of perl, ruby or python from the command line present a more powerful and integrated interface
   
  * awk - pattern scanning and processing language
  * sed - stream editor
  * tr - translate characters
  
  h2. Other
  
  * wget - fetch a URL and store locally
    wget http://website.com/path/file.html
    wget -x http://website.com/path/file.html # saves to path 'website.com/path/file.html'
    wget -r -l5 -nc -np [url] # rip recursively, 5 levels, don't reget, don't ascend in url.
