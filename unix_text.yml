  uniq - remove or report adjacent duplicate lines
  awk - pattern scanning and processing language
  sed - stream editor
  tr - translate characters
  diff - display line-by-line differences between pairs of text files
  grep, egrep, fgrep - search a file for a string or regular expression
  paste - join corresponding lines of several files, or subsequent lines of one file
  colrm - remove characters from specified columns within each line
  expand, unexpand - expand TAB characters to SPACE characters, and vice versa
