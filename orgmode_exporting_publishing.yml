  Exporting and Publishing
  ================================================================================
  
  Exporting creates files with extensions .txt and .html in the current
  directory.  Publishing puts the resulting file into some other place.

  Comments: Text not being exported
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Text before the first headline is not considered part of the document and is
  therefore never exported.  Lines starting with # are comments and are not
  exported.  Subtrees whose header starts with COMMENT are never exported.
  
  toggle COMMENT keyword on entry                   C-c ;
